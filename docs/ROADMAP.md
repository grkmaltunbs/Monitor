# Monitor Application Development Roadmap

## Executive Summary

The Monitor Application is a high-performance, real-time data visualization tool designed to process and display packet data at extreme throughput rates (10,000+ packets/second) with minimal latency (<5ms). This roadmap outlines a systematic 24-week development plan divided into 12 phases, ensuring modularity, testability, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for phase completion
- Performance benchmarks at each milestone
- 100% test coverage for critical paths

### 2. Performance-First Architecture
- Event-driven design with NO POLLING
- Lock-free data structures where possible
- Pre-allocated memory pools
- Multi-threaded processing pipeline
- Zero-copy mechanisms

### 3. Modular Design
- Each component independently testable
- Clear interface boundaries
- Dependency injection
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Separation of concerns

### 4. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Qt6 for UI consistency
- Platform-agnostic core logic
- CMake build system
- Continuous testing on macOS and Windows
